            <p>
               Hello! I'm a junior at Kennesaw State University, pursuing a 
               degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Data Analytics 
               and a minor in Math. While I‚Äôm currently building my practical experience, 
               I have a strong passion for data-driven solutions and technology. I'm eager 
               to apply my knowledge and grow through hands-on opportunities in the IT 
               and analytics field. Welcome to my journey!</p>

                  <h3>Convenient Investing</h3>
                  Convenient Investing is a Python project implementing the tkinter library. 
                  For this project, my partner and I mapped the project architecture, 
                  developed the pseudocode, made a schedule, and coded. This project connected 
                  people with the stock market, worldwide news, expert teachers to learn, and 
                  bank accounts. Beyond the MVP for this project, we would implement realtime access to the 
                  stock market, more accurate tracking of owned shares, specific learning modules to 
                  teach beginners, and a chat room to share opinions and suggestions. This project 
                  was completed for the KSU Fall 2022 Hackathon by Assurant, "Helping People Thrive 
                  in a Connected World".

                  <h3>Find Your Paradise</h3>
                  Find Your Paradise is an ECL (Enterprise Control 
                  Language) project that helps people find places to 
                  live that maximize their quality of life and happiness. 
                  For this project, my partners and I were provided with 
                  a series of datasets that held demographic information of 
                  several locations and our task was to provide choices in 
                  an easy-to-use form to the user that when submitted will 
                  generate a unique set of scores based on locations 
                  (Ex: by State). My group's twist to this project was 
                  collecting and organizing data from other sources; implementing 
                  our own datasets rather than the ones provided by the sponsor. This 
                  project was completed for the KSU Spring 2023 Hackathon by HPCC 
                  Systems, "For Social Good".

                  <h3>St. Theresa Reflection Area</h3>
                  The Eagle Scout Service Project gives a scout the opportunity
                  to demonstrate leadership while performing a project for the
                  benefit of their community. In my project I decided to build a
                  reflection area at my local church, St. Theresa's Catholic
                  Church. In the project, I built two benches, two flower beds, a
                  library, as well as some landscaping. Between planning,
                  organizing, and execution, this project took a grand total of 186
                  hours.
