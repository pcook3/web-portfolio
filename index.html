                  and task management for event staff. The app features a detailed shift page with assigned 
                  tasks, an interactive timeline to track progress, and real-time displays. Developed with HTML, 
                  CSS, JavaScript, and JSON, SafeStadium optimizes coordination and response times, ensuring a

                  <p>
                  Find Your Paradise is an ECL (Enterprise Control 
                  Language) project that helps people find places to 
                  live that maximize their quality of life and happiness. 
                  For this project, my partners and I were provided with 
                  a series of datasets that held demographic information of 
                  several locations and our task was to provide choices in 
                  an easy-to-use form to the user that when submitted will 
                  generate a unique set of scores based on locations 
                  (Ex: by State). My group's twist to this project was 
                  collecting and organizing data from other sources; implementing 
                  our own datasets rather than the ones provided by the sponsor. This 
                  project was completed for the KSU Spring 2023 Hackathon by HPCC 
                  Systems, "For Social Good".

                  <p>
                  The Eagle Scout Service Project gives a scout the opportunity
                  to demonstrate leadership while performing a project for the
                  benefit of their community. In my project I decided to build a
                  reflection area at my local church, St. Theresa's Catholic
                  Church. In the project, I built two benches, two flower beds, a
                  library, as well as some landscaping. Between planning,
                  organizing, and execution, this project took a grand total of 186
                  hours.
